Tasks:
- visualization
    - color move visualizations
    - animate ninja dog
        - add different body angles side and back?
        - sword swing hit slash effect?
            - maybe try some line flash line following the blade?
    - what could i use a shader for?


Game Vision:
- speed dog ninja 
    - when players draws blade, time stops
    - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
    - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
    - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
    - try to use shaders to make it look "better"

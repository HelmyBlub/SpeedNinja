- multiplayer
    - on entering shop
        - every player needs to enter
        - revive dead players
        - check move piece reset in shop for other player
    - combine:
        - when piece to big scale down
            - was bad code, need rework for multiplayer
    - bosses not targeting dead players
        - bug: dragon boss can target dead players
- some settings info area
    - display how to mutliplayer
        - display "hold button to join" if different input devices used
            - only when on one player

- new game plus
    - check snowball being to slow?

- vertical layout
    - gate/stairs outside of view
    - overlapping stuff

Next ideas:
- improve UX
    - shop
        - spend money: "kaching"
    - speedrun stats
    - free continues
- multiplayer
    - boss hp scaling
    - player speedrun stats?
        - multiplayer don't display?
            - only when run over?
    - kick player option
        - in shop "kick afk players" when idle player detected
            - idle when no input in  1min
            - stand on tile for 5seconds
        - if player left when no timer in combat, should give kick option
- shop move piece 
    - visualize shop correctly
- vulkan changes
    - fallback visulize when not supported
    - console log when having validation layers on

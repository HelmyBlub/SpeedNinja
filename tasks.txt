Tasks:
- wait on user feedback for mouse positions on other project to implement here too
- visualization
    - continue:
        - hand should be moveable to "any" location
        - sword should be in hand
        - make hand move to mouse loction to try around?
    - animate ninja dog
        - sword animation
            - swing sword
            - sword in paw
        - eye pupils move
        - bandana swings
        - dog body moving up down when stationary
        - after move:
            - bandana swings more because moved fast
            - finish blade swing
            - maybe turn body back to front
        - once tile choosen: put blade in hands
    - what could i use a shader for?


Game Vision:
- speed dog ninja 
    - when players draws blade, time stops
    - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
    - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
    - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
    - try to use shaders to make it look "better"

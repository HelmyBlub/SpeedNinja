Tasks:
- next enemy
    - continue: 
            - enemy not spawn on wall
            - waller not block area off
                - only block 2 directions
                - if more blocked, open one up
    - waller enemy
      - places tile which block path, enemies can not spawn on them
        - after some initial delay
        - should not be able to block itself out
    - after blocking tiles placed, attacks randomly to open directions

- next boss idea
    - boss creats blocking tiles in some way and destroys them in another way
        - blocking tiles fall from the sky onto player position after boss makes attack
            - onto every tile player moves over in time period
                - player should move as little as possible
            - on spawn do damage, push player randomly away if hit
        - boss shots ball in player direction, bounces off wall and destorys it

- small change: debug time to mm:ss
- think: change random position to single function instead of duplicate with small differenes?
- think: change enemy code more to boss code
    - less functions all over the place

        - enemies gain new abilities 
        - new enemy types
        - boss rounds
    - player has HP

- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive

- enemy ideas
    - enemy which attacks when player adjacent
    - enemy which trows projectile when player in view
        - projectiles moves in intervals one tile
        - player can deflect projectile, which than damages enemies (weapon upgrade?)
    - enemy moves with always the same move piece which is also an attack (like player) 
    - enemy throws piece aoe
- player upgrades
    - piece corner effect
    - start effect
    - end effect

    - end tile aoe
    - throw projectile on tile
    
- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

- early end level
    - when round x reached, make tile to finish so player can progress faster, although less money

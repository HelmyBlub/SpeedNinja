- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive
- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster

- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

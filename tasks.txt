Tasks:
- end boss dragon
    - dev steps:
        - phase 3:
            - tail attack
                - body to ground
                - tail in the air
                - move close enough to player
                - turn back towards player
                - tail to the ground stomp

    - player takes damage outside of area
        - will use properller ears to fly
            - but takes damage each seconds
    - boss platform is limited, no able to go outside of area
        - should be high a platform, can fall down at the edges
    
    - check for multiplayer
        - body stomp choose closest player
    - change order of attacks to be not completly random
         - two fire breath max without wing blast to prevent to much fire
    - move feet does damage, if boss to easy in the end?

- check: does invulnerability reset on restart?
- think: change random position to single function instead of duplicate with small differenes?
- waller enemy
    - unreachable wall closed up
        - possible, but hard to prevent?
    - unreachable with ice
        - possible, but hard to prevent
    - idea: onTileChange (limit by only once per x seconds)
        - pathfind from player to all enemies
        - if one is not reachable?

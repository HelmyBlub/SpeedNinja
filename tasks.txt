Tasks:
- next boss
    - continue: boss split in air move parts
    - boss splits when cut into two smaller pieces
        - destroying small bosses first is more secure as less projectiles
        - how do weapons with more damage work?
            - boss splits based on health
               - split total 3 tiems 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 
    - throw projectiles in all 4 direction in intervals
    - move around in a circle pattern

Next ideas:
- something which makes player stronger over time, but better player get stronger faster
    - 2 new enemies all 5 levels
    - 1 boss all 5 levels
    - until level 50
    - after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster

    - boss abilities shown by enemies before for easier learning
    - buy equippment which is visualized on character
        - only certan slots: feet slot, weapong slot, head slot, chest slot
        - weapon: for damage
    - difficulty rises
        - enemies gain new abilities 
        - new enemy types
        - boss rounds
    - player has HP

- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive

- enemy ideas
    - enemy moves one tile which is also attack move
    - enemy which attacks on time intervals
    - enemy which attacks after player moved x-times
    - enemy which attacks when player adjacent
    - enemy which trows projectile when player in view
        - projectiles moves in intervals one tile
        - player can deflect projectile, which than damages enemies (weapon upgrade?)
    - enemy places damaging tile and moves one tile
    - enemy moves with always the same move piece which is also an attack (like player) 
    - enemy throws piece aoe
- player upgrades
    - piece corner effect
    - start effect
    - end effect

    - end tile aoe
    - throw projectile on tile
    
- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

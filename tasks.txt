testruns:
- try run newGame+2?
- speed run normal mode
    - speedrun stategy(43:25, 3death)


Tasks:
- bug: on level start enemy can be on player position
- speedrun statistics
    - continue: slider position incorrect on start
        - change: slider position should not be part of position setup and calculated on paint based on percent
        - something was confusing with slider width hight being calculated differently
    - slider for future level display
    - slider for max level display

    - settings menu explanation of options
    - 5-level grouping
    - shopping average time
    - display stats when game finished
- be able to choose new game plus on start
    - available once game beaten on normal mode

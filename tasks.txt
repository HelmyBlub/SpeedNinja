Tasks:
- visualization
    - change: don't spawn tree on player
    - visualize pieces left counter and max piece count
    - steps:
        - animate ninja dog
            - move path should have dog after images to see where he went
                - move do over few frames instead of instant
            - once tile choosen: put blade in hands
        - animate enemy death
            - tree should be cut randomly and fall
        - what could i use a shader for?
    - dog ninja with sword
    - enemies ? evil ninjas ?


Game Vision:
- speed dog ninja 
    - when players draws blade, time stops
    - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
    - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
    - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
    - try to use shaders to make it look "better"

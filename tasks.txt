Tasks:
- remove float64 dependency
- make one shader for cpu code test usage
- visualization
    - steps:
        - animate enemy death
            - "fall down"
                - rotate pieces
                - force value: fly further when cut
                - fly path
        - animate ninja dog
            - eye pupils move
            - bandana swings
            - dog body moving up down when stationary
            - after move:
                - bandana swings more because moved fast
                - finish blade swing
                - maybe turn body back to front
            - once tile choosen: put blade in hands
        - what could i use a shader for?
    - dog ninja with sword
    - enemies ? evil ninjas ?


Game Vision:
- speed dog ninja 
    - when players draws blade, time stops
    - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
    - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
    - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
    - try to use shaders to make it look "better"

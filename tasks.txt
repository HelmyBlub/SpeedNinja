testruns:
- gain all achievements on steam
    - newGame+2

    - remember to connect to steam


Tasks:
- automated testing
    - dev steps:
        - freeze time not working
            - is wait counter off?
        - option: make replay run as fast as possible
            - can be taken as performance measure
             42 -> 3.4
             42 -> 2.0
        - save to file
            - use as automated test
        
    - deterministic behavior
        - fixed tick speed
            - for test case can be unlimited
        - possible frame skips (deterministic for tests)
        - replay run to measure performance
        - check time freeze

Next ideas:    
- code performance
    - automated testing
    - check performance change when: onePiexelXVulkan calculation only once
- game ticking seperate from drawing

- vulkan changes
    - fallback visualize when not supported
- disable debug keys

- pratice mode
- pvp
- visualize achievments in game
- modifiers
    - before game start set modifiers to make game easier or harder
        - gain more/less money
        - more time/less
        - newGamePlus
        - more start pieces
        - round requirment for continue to next level
        - max start enemies
- steam leaderboard?

Tasks:
- bug: game endless loop on wave 148
    - what could be reason?
- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster
    - on ++ (level 100+)
        - give bosses sudden death timer
        - instead of timer: dragon boss gets p3 stomp slowly destroys size of platform 
    - measure time from 1-50. from 51 to 100
    - option to start on level 51
- bug: visualization missing boss rotate shield
- boss dragon fire sound for flying phase


Next ideas:
- sound for sudden death
- improve move options UX
- improve shop UX
- multiplayer
- no vulkan support alternative
    - validation layer case
- shop move piece 
    - pricing change
    - visualize shop correctly
- vulkan changes
    - fallback visulize when not supported
    - console log when having validation layers on

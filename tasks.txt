testruns:
- gain all achievements on steam
    - newGame+1
    - no damage taken
    - newGame+2

    - remember to connect to steam


Tasks:
- bug: speedrun stats incorrect.
    - showed 3h at the end but 1:3x:xx with speedrun stats
    - 90min shooping time incorrect? should it be added to next level?
- automated testing
    - get a sense of fps: 166 fps
    - deterministic behavior
        - fixed tick speed
            - for test case can be unlimited
            - decide for UpdatesPerSecond value: 200// currently was ~166
            - should i make a limit fps value?
            - game should not go below 30fps
            - game 
        - possible frame skips (deterministic for tests)
        - replay run to measure performance

Next ideas:    
- code performance
    - automated testing
    - check performance change when: onePiexelXVulkan calculation only once
- game ticking seperate from drawing

- vulkan changes
    - fallback visualize when not supported
- disable debug keys

- pratice mode
- pvp
- visualize achievments in game
- modifiers
    - before game start set modifiers to make game easier or harder
        - gain more/less money
        - more time/less
        - newGamePlus
        - more start pieces
        - round requirment for continue to next level
        - max start enemies
- steam leaderboard?

            - +hp
        - roller blades
            - short fire immunity after move
            - can not move backwards (opposide to last direction)
        - time shoes
            - increase round time limit for required rounds
        - barefoot
            - +damage

            - x2 damage
            - blind => don't display selected move piece
        - image: eyepatch
            - +damage
            - can not choose move piece, but order of next 2 are displayed instead
    - weapon    
        - blade
            - a bit bonus damage
        - big hammer
            - aoe at move piece end
        - kunai
            - throw kunai each move piece edge for 2 pieces far
        - gold weapon  
            - increase money gained
            - less damage
    - body/chest
        - always one option for +hp?
           +1 hp
           +2 hp
        - +damage

    
- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive
- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster

- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

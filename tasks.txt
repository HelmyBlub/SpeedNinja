speed run normal mode
    - kunai  (52min)
    - blade  (53min)
    - hammer (46min)
    - speedrun stategy(43:25, 3death)
- play test for freeze time

Tasks:
- freeze time when being hit, time continue after next move input
    - need more enemy hit animations animations, so freeze time is easier to understand what hit the player
        - boss dragon
- shop boss hint next level
- level 1 no sudden death, but respawn stop

Next ideas:
- settings
    - save/load settings
    - speedrun statistics options
- steam achievements
- game ticking seperate from drawing

- vulkan changes
    - fallback visualize when not supported
- settings menu
    - display how to mutliplayer
        - display "hold button to join" if different input devices used
            - only when on one player
- disable debug keys
- pratice mode
- pvp
- modifiers
    - before game start set modifiers to make game easier or harder

        - newGamePlus
        - more start pieces
        - round requirment for continue to next level

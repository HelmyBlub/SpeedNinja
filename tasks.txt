Next ideas:
- 1 new enemies all 5 levels
- 1 boss all 5 levels

- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster
- something which makes player stronger over time, but better player get stronger faster

    - boss abilities shown by enemies before for easier learning
    - buy equippment which is visualized on character
        - only certan slots: feet slot, weapong slot, head slot, chest slot
        - weapon: for damage
    - difficulty rises
        - enemies gain new abilities 
        - new enemy types
        - boss rounds
    - player has HP

- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive

- enemy ideas
    - enemy throws piece aoe
- player upgrades
    - piece corner effect
    - start effect
    - end effect

    - end tile aoe
    - throw projectile on tile
    
- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

- early end level
    - when round x reached, make tile to finish so player can progress faster, although less money

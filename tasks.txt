Tasks:
- time measurement save by game
    - save best time per level
    - save best pace until level
    - save highest round reached on level
    - disabled when using debug keys
    - measure shopping times
    -
    - taking damage counter for level
    - key to reset as i often change stuff making old times not compareable

- when bought new equipment, place old equipment at position to be able to switch back
- boss split: split correct amount of times even for high damage values
- shop should have one weapon buy option always

- think: change random position to single function instead of duplicate with small differenes?
- waller enemy
    - unreachable wall closed up
        - possible, but hard to prevent?
    - unreachable with ice
        - possible, but hard to prevent
    - idea: onTileChange (limit by only once per x seconds)
        - pathfind from player to all enemies
        - if one is not reachable?

Next ideas:
- retries for money?
    - each retry gets more expensive
- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster
- when out of pieces, instead of losing instantly, projectile will drop on player, player takes damage and gets two move pieces back if he has HP
- instead of losing instantly on time over, make sudden death, projectiles will drop on every tile slowly growing inwards

- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

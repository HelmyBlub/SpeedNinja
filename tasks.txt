Tasks:
- waller enemy
    - continue: 
        - check debug output for more cases
        - modify map to make it reachable
    - unreachable wall closed up
        - possible, but hard to prevent?
    - unreachable with ice
        - possible, but hard to prevent
- think: change random position to single function instead of duplicate with small differenes?

Next ideas:
- continues
    - for money
        - each retry gets more expensive
    - for acing bosses
        - one retry for first ace, second retry for 3 bosses aced, third retry for 6 bosses aced

- after level 50 start new game+, repeat bosses but stuff gets harder, faster
- sound for sudden death
- improve move options UX
- improve shop UX
- multiplayer
- no vulkan support alternative
    - validation layer case

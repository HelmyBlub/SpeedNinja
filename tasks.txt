Tasks:
- boss round
    - visualization:
        - boss in air
            - paint him higher
            - paint shadow
        - tileWarnings paint before boss
    - boss round ux
        - hp bar for boss
        - boss name?
    - sounds
    - prevent boss from leaving grid

    - retries for money?
        - each retry gets more expensive
- shop: prevent same piece from being sold
- bug: dog animation independant from time skips
    - when time stops or leaps forward ear flap alot
- check: vulkan vertice limits checked when adding

Next ideas:
- something which makes player stronger over time, but better player get stronger faster
    - round = spawn enemies and increases once all enemies are defeated
    - level = start level 1, once time is up, shop phase starts, level goes up by 1
        - 100 levels, each 10 levels a boss
            - boss needs more than 1 hit
    - give player 1 minute after first kill
        - 5 rounds have to be completed to be allowed to reach next level
        - if timer < 30 and round < 5, set timer to 30seconds
        - if timer runs out and round 5 not reached, player loses
        - else next level

    - money can be spent after times up
        - buy equippment which is visualized on character
            - only certan slots: feet slot, weapong slot, head slot, chest slot
            - e.g: chest which gives more hp
            - weapon: for damage
        - heal? or auto heal?
    - difficulty rises
        - enemies gain new abilities 
        - new enemy types
        - boss rounds
    - player has HP
    - player can die

- enemy ideas
    - enemy which attacks on time intervals
    - enemy which attacks after player moved x-times
    - enemy which attacks when player adjacent
    - enemy which trows projectile when player in view
        - projectiles moves in intervals one tile
        - player can deflect projectile, which than damages enemies (weapon upgrade?)
    - enemy places damaging tile and moves one tile
    - enemy moves one tile which is also attack move
    - enemy moves with always the same move piece which is also an attack (like player) 
    - enemy throws piece aoe
- player upgrades
    - piece corner effect
    - start effect
    - end effect

    - end tile aoe
    - throw projectile on tile

    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

- early end level

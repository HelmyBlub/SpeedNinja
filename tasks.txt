Tasks:
- shopping phase
    - spend money for piece changes
        - continue: cut piece 1 not working
        - cut tool
            - player can move on shop grid and decide where to cut
        
    - shopping phase should work with multiple players
- random move pieces
    - check that random move pieces can reach any tile and don't lock to certain ones
    - how to display selected move piece when questionable pattern?
        - i don't feel like i should disable certain pieces


Next ideas:
- something which makes player stronger over time, but better player get stronger faster
    - round = spawn enemies and increases once all enemies are defeated
    - level = start level 0, once time is up, shop phase starts, level goes up by 1
        - 100 levels, each 10 level a boss
            - boss needs more than 1 hit
    - give player 1 minute after first kill
        - each finished round gives 5 seconds
    - each round finished gives money

    - money can be spent after times up
        - piece changes
            - add new piece
            - delete piece
            - combine two pices
            - split one pice
        - buy equippment which is visualized on character
            - only certan slots: feet slot, weapong slot, head slot, chest slot
            - e.g: chest which gives more hp
            - weapon: for damage
        - heal? or auto heal?
    - difficulty rises
        - enemies gain new abilities 
        - new enemy types
        - boss rounds
    - player has HP
    - player can die

- enemy ideas
    - enemy which attacks on time intervals
    - enemy which attacks after player moved x-times
    - enemy which attacks when player adjacent
    - enemy which trows projectile when player in view
        - projectiles moves in intervals one tile
        - player can deflect projectile, which than damages enemies (weapon upgrade?)
    - enemy places damaging tile and moves one tile
    - enemy moves one tile which is also attack move
    - enemy moves with always the same move piece which is also an attack (like player) 
    - enemy throws piece aoe
- player upgrades
    - piece corner effect
    - start effect
    - end effect

    - end tile aoe
    - throw projectile on tile
    
- game modifier
    - can be choosen -> more money per round, but harder or different
    - no choice but more damage
    - no refresh
        - turn more into puzzle game
        - can only use each pice once
        - no time limit, but piece limit
    - only one piece and copies of it
    - chunky enemies: more hp -> no/easier attack pattens

- early end level
    - when round x reached, make tile to finish so player can progress faster, although less money
